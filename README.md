# MolStove - Program for Calculating Molecular Properties

This is our attempt at creating an open-source version of the DFT simulations used to create the Harvard Clean energy project dataset.
A workshop paper was pubished at the 2020 ICLR workshop on [Fundamental Science in the AI Era](https://iclr2020-fsai.github.io/FSAI/) workshop.
Since then, this project was not updated.
We are open sourcing it in case it is useful to future researchers.
